## We Take Showers (Team 24) Final Project

### What is this app?
<!--Name/Title, Main Purpose, Features, Screenshots, Videos -->
FUTURE NOW! is an app created for entertainment purposes, allowing users a quick and fun way to get a read on their future. Our application has two main components to it that users can use to tell their future: 8 ball and tarot card readings.


### How do I use this app?
- In root directory, run `npm i`, then run `npm run dev`. 
- Getting Started: Most things will be explained in [Help!](pages/instructions/index.html) 
  <!--Usage, Examples, API Reference -->


### TODO List:
- [ ] Add Back Button in 8 ball
- [ ] Make results Page
- [x] Make cards scattered across page instead of just vertical
- [ ] Web component for having the card pop up
- [ ] Add an 8ball image to home page of 8ball
- [ ] fix website
- [ ] Unit tests
- [x] Comment the code
- [x] retrospective
- [x] show off ci/cd pipeline


### Possible Features
- [ ] Change history to be what your past readings were
- [ ] Offer tarot readings in multiple languages
- [ ] Have it read out the tarot readings in a voice


[**CI/CD_Pipeline**](admin/cipipeline/phase1.mp4)
  - JSDoc: Documentation (simply add comments before the function with /** /)
    - run `npm run jsdoc ./scripts`
    - then open website with liveserver
  - ESLint: Automatically checks for style points
    - you can also run `npm run eslint ./scripts`
  - Code Climate: Automatically reviews the quality of our code
    - you can also go to https://codeclimate.com/login/github/join 
    - it also notifies our slack when a push is made
  - Cypress: E2E Testing
    - make tests
    - run `npm run cypress:open`
    - click e2e testing
    - click your browser
    - run tests
  - Jest: Create Unit Tests
    - make unit tests
    - run `npm run test`   
  

### How was this app built?
 <!-- How Well Built, including quality indicators, badges, coverage, etc.
  Quality Indicators tools: www.codefactor.io
  Talk about how this app was built -->
- While we were going to initally use Electron to create a desktop app, the Professor suggested that we should go for a mobile-first approach as most users will be engaging with our content via their phone. Thus, we instead went to go with vite. It allows us to create a web application that scales perfectly between phone and laptop. 


### Guidelines for merging/pushing
  - Make Issue for every new feature/page
  - Make a branch for that specific issue/page
  - Push to that Branch
  - Write THOUGHTFUL commit messages
  

### Coding Guidelines
  - Comment every function
  - Use proper styling
  - 4 spaces for tabs
  - only have a new line between functions
  - use prettier
  

### Folders + Repository Organization
  - .github/workflows: yml files for eslint and jsdoc
  - admin 
    - cipipeline: cypress files, node_modules, test files for code climate and eslint, ci/cd pipeline essentials
    - meetings: meeting notes
  - node_modules
  - pages (html and js and css files)
    - 8ball: 8ball features
    - about-us: about us page

### App Creators

Hi! We are undergraduate students currently attending University of California, San Diego. We are enrolled in CSE 110, a class about software engineering and this is our final project. We came up with the idea of tarot cards and 8 ball because we are passionate about using our software engineering skills to create forms of entertainment and add some fun to fortune telling in a creative way.
